# Paint App

A simple drawing application for Android that allows users to draw on a canvas with multiple colors. 

After putting this together, I noticed that changing the phone's orientation clears everything on the screen. While this was an unintended bug, it works works well as a quick way to reset the canvas, especially since I hadn't implemented a clear or erase function.
## Features
- Freehand drawing on a canvas.
- Multiple color options (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black).
- Smooth strokes using anti-aliasing and rounded joins.

## How It Works
- Touch the color you want and paint with it.
- Rotating the phone by changing its orientation (e.g., switching from portrait to landscape or vice versa) will clear what you have painted.
